    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Homepage - <i>index.html</b></i>
            <p>The homepage will be the first page that the users will see when they visit the site. 
                Here we’ll have a navigation bar where you can navigate to different parts of the website with one click. 
                The homepage will also include a picture slideshow. At the bottom of the site there will be contact information on customer service and also a short FAQ. 
                The main content of the homepage will be our deals and student discounts. These will be displayed as a slideshow, which is going to capture the user’s 
                attention as soon as he/she enters the page. The slideshow is going to run automatically, but the user can also click through the different deals. 
                We took our mobile users into consideration, and decided to not make their slideshow automatic. </p>
